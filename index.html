        <p><strong>双魂终结 — Shuāng Hún Zhōng Jié</strong></p>
        <p>
          Long ago, two souls were deeply connected. One rose as a loyal protector of the heavens, while the other fell into darkness and became a demon lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the world is on the edge of destruction. The gods and demons are at war, and these two former companions stand on opposite sides. One fights to defend what remains, and the other seeks revenge against the heavens that betrayed him.
        </p>
        <p>
          As their paths cross again, old memories and buried emotions resurface. Their final battle will not only decide the fate of the mortal realm, but also which soul will remain… and which will vanish forever.

          <!-- PROLOGUE TEXT -->
          <p><em>The End of Two Souls</em></p>
          <p>In the year of the 1800s, when the war between the celestial gods and demonic lords reached its peak, two figures stood at the eye of the storm, locked in a battle not just for dominion, but for destiny.</p>
          <p>One man, adorned with divine radiance like a faint golden crown hovering above him, pointed a gleaming holy sword at the throat of the other.</p>
          <p>A mask covered half of his face, cracked, incomplete and yet his eyes were resolute.</p>
          <p>Around them, the world burned. Flames devoured cities, screams of the innocent echoed across the land, and yet... he had but one purpose.</p>
          <p><strong>To kill his other half.</strong></p>
          <p>The masked warrior moved with elegance and precision, every strike steeped in the grace of royal discipline, like a forgotten prince of heaven.</p>
          <p>His opponent, however, fought with raw fury. His blows were brutal, desperate, like a beast backed into a corner. He fought not just for survival, but for something deeper.</p>
          <p>Their robes, once symbols of nobility and pride, now fluttered in tatters as the duel intensified, each clash of steel like thunder in the sky.</p>
          <p>They danced through the air as if heaven itself were the stage and fate, the audience.</p>
          <p>The heavens wept lightning. Beasts howled beneath them. The earth trembled with each swing of their blades.</p>
          <p><em>Cling. Clang.</em></p>
          <p>Sparks lit the darkness. With a final, fluid step forward, the masked man drove his blade through his enemy's abdomen, pinning him to the ground. Blood bloomed like a red lotus across shattered stone.</p>
          <p>And still, the fallen man smiled. Even as tears streaked down his face.</p>
          <p>"So this is how our story ends," the masked man murmured.</p>
          <p>His voice was quiet, almost hollow, as if he had rehearsed those words a thousand times, yet never believed he'd speak them.</p>
          <p>"Don't..." the other whispered weakly, golden light flickering from his wounds like dying embers. "Don't let them turn against you. Don't let the world hate you."</p>
          <p>His voice wavered, not just from pain, but sorrow. It was more than the blade in his body that hurt him.</p>
          <p>The masked man stood silent, his brows drawing together. His lips pressed into a thin line, suppressing words that trembled on the edge of his tongue. For a moment, his hand faltered.</p>
          <p>But it was too late.</p>
          <p>The light began to scatter. The man beneath him started to fade, his form dissolving into golden motes that floated toward the sky, like a soul ascending.</p>
          <p>The masked man closed his eyes.</p>
          <p>And then... he smiled.</p>
          <p>But it was not the smile of victory.</p>
          <p>It was twisted. Cold. Empty.</p>
          <p>"Now then," he whispered, standing tall, "I suppose it's time to clean up, isn't it?"</p>
          <p>He raised his sword to the sky—and released a surge of darkness so vast, so venomous, the very air turned thick with death. Shadows burst outward in a wave, devouring everything in their path.</p>
          <p>His yin, his balance, his soul, was unraveling.</p>
          <p>This was not redemption.</p>
          <p><strong>This was revenge.</strong></p>
          <p>And in that moment, half the world was swallowed by shadow.</p>

          <p><em>The years had not been kind to Xin Zhi.</em></p>
          <p>In the Heavenly Court, whispers followed him wherever he went.</p>
          <p>“He’s a weak god…”</p>
          <p>“Only knows how to heal scratches…”</p>
          <p>“A candle in the wind—better snuffed out than sheltered.”</p>
          <p>Xin Zhi smiled softly, as he always did, and let the words pass through him like rain on stone. His days were spent in quiet routines—healing the injured, tending to mortal prayers, and walking in the gardens with Emperor Rui, the only friend who offered him a fragment of warmth. Rui’s fondness had grown beyond mere friendship, though Xin Zhi, gentle and unassuming, never pressed to understand it.</p>
          <p>But Rui was no longer his own man. Strings pulled from the shadows dictated his every move, and one day, those strings tightened into a noose for Xin Zhi.</p>
          <p>Without warning, a decree was issued: Xin Zhi was to join the battlefield.</p>
          <p>No explanation.</p><p>No protest.</p><p>And Xin Zhi… accepted.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, deep down, he had always expected this.</p>
          <p>The mortal realm was chaos incarnate.</p>
          <p>Demons erupted from the cracked earth like a plague, their roars shaking the mountains. Soldiers clashed steel against claw, and banners were swallowed by smoke. Amid the frenzy, a junior soldier stumbled onto the frontline, armored robes ill-fitted, face hidden behind a polished metal helm.</p>
          <p>It was Xin Zhi.</p>
          <p>He was meant to serve as a healer—Mo Yuan himself had requested one for the legions—but no one had told Xin Zhi his role. Seeing soldiers charge forward, he simply followed, believing that was his duty. If death awaited him in the frontlines, he would accept that too.</p>
          <p>From afar, Mo Yuan—commanding the Five Legions—caught sight of him.</p>
          <p>The soldier’s sword swings were clumsy and far too wide. He tripped over corpses, nearly stabbed an ally, and at one point, managed to decapitate a demon that was already dead. To Mo Yuan, the display was not only maddening—it was deadly.</p>
          <p>The formation faltered, the flank broke, and the demons surged in. When the raid finally ended, the ground was soaked with blood, and the soldiers’ eyes were heavy with grief.</p>
          <p>Mo Yuan’s fury simmered like a silent storm.</p>
          <p>The command tent was suffocating in its stillness.</p>
          <p>A lone soldier knelt on the rug, metal helm pressed to the floor in shame. Mo Yuan loomed over him, voice cold and sharp.</p>
          <p>“Explain yourself.”</p>
          <p>“I… I thought I was supposed to fight…” The voice was soft, uncertain.</p>
          <p>“Fight?” Mo Yuan’s tone rose, a low rumble of restrained rage. “You cost me soldiers’ lives today. You broke the line. Who taught you to wield a sword?”</p>
          <p>“…No one,” came the whisper.</p>
          <p>The words only twisted the knife in Mo Yuan’s chest. He reached for his folded fan—an emblem of command—and in a flash of anger, he hurled it at the soldier’s head.</p>
          <p><em>Clang!</em></p>
          <p>The helm fell away, rolling across the floor.</p>
          <p>Mo Yuan froze. His breath caught, and the world seemed to still.</p>
          <p>Kneeling before him, face streaked with dust and sweat, was Xin Zhi.</p>
          <p>Eyes like quiet stars lifted to meet his, shimmering with unshed tears. And then—unbelievably—Xin Zhi smiled, soft and forgiving, as if the fan had not struck him, as if the entire world had not just tried to crush him.</p>
          <p>Mo Yuan’s heart twisted. He had longed for this moment for years—longed to stand before Xin Zhi as his equal, as his protector. He had trained, bled, and endured countless battles to become strong enough to face him.</p>
          <p>And the first time fate placed them together… he had hurt him.</p>
          <p>Xin Zhi’s voice was gentle, almost timid.</p>
          <p>“…I’m sorry. I must have caused you trouble.”</p>
          <p>Mo Yuan’s hands curled into fists. Words stuck in his throat—grief, guilt, relief, and the sharp pain of recognition. He had imagined their reunion as something proud, something noble. Instead, it was this: Xin Zhi kneeling before him in disgrace, smiling through the sting of his tears.</p>
          <p>Mo Yuan dropped to one knee, his voice low, rough.</p>
          <p>“…I… should have recognized you.”</p>
          <p>Xin Zhi blinked, tilting his head slightly, still smiling. “…You threw that fan really hard.”</p>
          <p>Mo Yuan’s lips trembled between a frown and a smile. He had spent years building himself into a wall of iron and command, and in a single moment, Xin Zhi had cracked him open with nothing but a smile.</p>
