      <p class="desc ornament"><em>双魂终结 Shuāng Hún Zhōng Jié</em></p>
      <p class="desc">
        Long ago, two souls were bound. One rose as a loyal protector of the heavens, the other fell into shadow and became a demon lord.
        Now the realms stand on the brink. Heaven and demons clash, and the two old companions take opposite sides.
        When their paths cross again, memory and buried feeling awaken. Their final struggle will decide the fate of mortals,
        and which soul remains… and which vanishes.
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        A reincarnated soul without memory, a god bound by sin, and a forest that keeps every vow.
        Snow falls in summer when the heavens lie, and petals drift when blades are drawn.

        <h3>Sample</h3>
        <p><em>The years had not been kind to Xin Zhi.</em></p>
        <p>In the Heavenly Court, whispers followed him wherever he went.</p>
        <p>“He’s a weak god…” “Only knows how to heal scratches…” “A candle in the wind—better snuffed out than sheltered.”</p>
        <p>Xin Zhi smiled softly, as he always did, and let the words pass like rain on stone. His days were quiet—healing the injured, tending mortal prayers, walking the gardens with Emperor Rui, the only friend who offered him warmth. Rui’s fondness ran deeper than friendship, though Xin Zhi, gentle and unassuming, did not press to name it.</p>
        <p>Then came a decree: Xin Zhi was to join the battlefield. No explanation. No protest. He accepted.</p>
        <p>The mortal realm was chaos. Demons rose like a plague. Amid the clash, a junior soldier stumbled into the front line, armor ill-fitted, helm polished bright. He was meant to be a healer—Mo Yuan had requested one—but no one told Xin Zhi. Seeing soldiers charge, he followed.</p>
        <p>From afar, Mo Yuan, commander of the Five Legions, saw him. The soldier’s swings were wide, his footing clumsy; he nearly struck allies and decapitated a demon already dead. The formation faltered. When the raid ended, the ground was red, and Mo Yuan’s fury was a storm inside his ribs.</p>
        <p>In the command tent, silence weighed heavy. A lone soldier knelt, helm pressed to the rug. “Explain yourself,” Mo Yuan said.</p>
        <p>“I… thought I should fight.”</p>
        <p>“Fight? You broke the line. Who taught you to wield a sword?”</p>
        <p>“…No one.”</p>
        <p>Mo Yuan’s hand moved before his heart did. The command fan left his grip—<em>clang</em>—the helm rolled aside, and the world stopped. Xin Zhi looked up, eyes like quiet stars, a small smile already softening the bruise.</p>
        <p>Mo Yuan’s voice cracked between anger and relief. “…I should have recognized you.”</p>
        <p>Xin Zhi tilted his head. “…You threw that fan very hard.”</p>
